    This example application analyzes and stores customer feedback cards. Specifically,
    it fulfills the need of a fictitious hotel in New York City. The hotel receives feedback
    from guests in various languages in the form of physical comment cards. That feedback
    is uploaded into the app through a web client.

    After an image of a comment card is uploaded, the following steps occur:
