# Multi-Language Integration Test Runner

This directory contains the source and infrastructure code for running multi-language integration tests in AWS.

## Problem and solution statement

This repository contains example code written in [11 of the AWS-supported Software Development Kit (SDK) languages](../../README.md#how-this-repository-is-organized).
This code must be tested to ensure its accuracy and functionality over time.
However, while this repository contains comprehensive test coverage, each test must be manually triggered and can take many hours to complete.

This solution offers centralized triggering and language-agnostic test orchestration. In exchange, it requires "automation-friendly" tests and the deployment of the following AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) stacks.

## Design features

The following design features make this tool easy to use:

- **Serverless** - Requires no stateful infrastructure
- **No pipeline** - Relies on events, not manual interaction
- **All code** - The entire solution is deployable by using the AWS CDK

## Architecture

This solution consists of the following CDK stacks:

| Stack                   | Function                                                                                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Images](stacks/images) | Holds versions of language-specialized Docker images.                                      | Event-based production of ready-to-run Docker images for each [supported SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/version-support-matrix.html). |
| [Admin](stacks/admin)   | Publishes a scheduled message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. | Centralized cron-based triggering of integration tests.                                                                                                     |
| [Plugin](stacks/plugin) | Consumes a message to trigger integration tests on AWS Batch with AWS Fargate.             | Federated integration testing of example code for each [supported SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/version-support-matrix.html).        |

These stacks depend on the presence of an image within the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repositories created
by the Images stack. See [image-production](#1-image-production).

## How it works

On the surface, this solution orchestrates the execution of distributed integration testing for the 11 [supported SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/version-support-matrix.html).
Under the hood, it relies on the source code in this repository and the following CDK stacks.

### 1. Image production

Image repositories are managed from an AWS account in which the [images stack](stacks/images) is deployed.

Through a secure integration, a GitHub Workflow configured [such as in this repository](../../.github/workflows/docker-push.yml) produces Docker images containing pre-built SDK code and publishes them to a private registry.

See [CDK stack](stacks/images).

### 2. Centralized eventing

Events are emitted from an AWS account in which the [Admin Stack](stacks/admin) is deployed.

This stack contains a cron-based Amazon EventBridge rule that writes to a singular SNS topic.
Through a cross-account integration, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues in different AWS accounts can subscribe to this topic.

See [CDK stack](stacks/admin).

### 3. Distributed testing

Testing is performed in AWS accounts in which the [Plugin Stack](stacks/plugin) is deployed.

This stack contains an AWS Lambda function that submits jobs to AWS Batch.
Through a secure integration, this Lambda function is triggered by an SQS queue that's subscribed to a cross-account topic.

See [CDK stack](stacks/plugin).

## Deployment

There are several options for deploying this stack.

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for more information.
