# Get started

## What is this?
This application is the front-end client for certain AWS code examples hosted at
[https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples).
Run this app in tandem with a local backend that supports one of these examples.

## Prerequisites
1. Install Node.js 18

## Run an example
Each example is composed of two pieces: this front-end client, and a backend service. Both
the client and the service need to be running on your local environment for the example to
run correctly.

### Run this app
1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples.git`.
2. Change directories to this project `cd aws-doc-sdk-examples/resources/clients/react/elwing`.
3. Run `npm start`.

### Find an example
Examples are listed in the navigation bar by name. The services used by the example are listed
in parentheses next to the name. For example, `Message (SQS)` would use Amazon Simple Queue Service
(Amazon SQS) to simulate a messaging application.

To see example instructions, choose one of the examples in the navigation bar.

### Run a backend service
Each example is supported by one or more backend services created with the AWS SDK. The
available backend services for a given example are listed on the example's page.
Choose one of the services and follow its installation instructions.
