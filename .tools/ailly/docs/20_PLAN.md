  Create a backronym using P L A N for iterating with Ailly. Be direct and

  professional, not poetic or whimsical. This backronym will summarize Ailly's

  project and workflow, so it needs to be approachable marketing copy. Do not include "Ailly" in any item.
  Prefer concrete actions, or nouns.
